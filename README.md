# fluxion
An educational implementation of a computational graph supporting gradient backpropagation. 
This repository is intended to demonstrate the core concepts and algorithms underlying deep learning frameworks like PyTorch.

It was inspired by [autodidact](https://github.com/mattjj/autodidact), 
and created while working through [these lecture slides](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/talks/Johnson-Automatic-Differentiation.pdf).
